# ALX Project - 0x0F. C - Function pointers

This project folder is a part of the requirements for the ALX Software Engineering Program.
The project is made up of tasks (files) on **Function pointers** in C.

## Learning Objectives

* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## Files

Bellow are all the files containing solutions to the tasks to meet the learning objectives.
